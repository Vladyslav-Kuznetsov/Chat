# Chat
Implement multithreading multiuser chat. Single app should be either client or client+server according to user choice. (would be a plus, but not required)
* Required functions:
  * Login/Register
  * Public chat: Chat for all connected users connected to the server
  * Private chat (chat with 2 users)
* It would be a plus, but not required:
  * Ability to create and communicate in private chats with multiple uses
  * Implement private chats using end2end data transfer(data transferred directly from one client to another)
  * Ability to find servers in local network(use UDP)
  * Store message history
